For running the Virtual machine:

I changed the network for my virtual machine in Oracle to a Bridged Adapter, and then chose the name as the Wifi that I was on. Then I got the IP address from entering the command "ip a" in the virtual machine and made sure it was the same as inthe playerScreen file in vscode. Then when I ran the code it would add the players in the screen to the database
